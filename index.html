I participate in various activities, such as competitive Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, rollerblading, and many academic services. Some include being a reading tutor for 1st - 3rd graders, a scholar in the program YPIE, or Yonkers Partners in Education, which has allowed me to take a science research class throughout my high school career, and multiple AP classes.</p>
